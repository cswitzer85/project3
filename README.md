# project3

Our groups final project, `project3` is a collaborative endeavour and the culmination of the skills developed in the Southern Methodist University Coding Boot Camp. After reaching out to local (DFW) pizza operation ZaLat, we decided to build a pizza order application with MySQL, Express, React and Node (MERN) using Zalat's unique pizza options as inspiration.

## About the Project

As we progressed through the initial coursework at SMU Dallas, none of us would have thought that we would be finishing the last 1/3rd of the program from home. While learning and working in these conditions are challenging it pales in comparison to the challenges that face local food chains. A large motivator for our group was to hopefully create something tangible that could eventually be utiilized by a real local small business operation. Our primary goal was to create an application that was built from the start as a mobile first design and has a high potential to become a Progressive Web Application with minimal adjustment. With the timeline given and each team members unique home/work life situation, we have created something that each of us are certainly proud to be a part of!

## Getting Started

Navigate to the URL in your favoirte browser and view available pizzas. If you crave more you create a login with an e-mail and password that will allow you to placde an order. The user name and passwored is stored in a database, so you can come back any time with the same login and order more pizzas!

## Usage

The main page displays all available pizzas along with a photo and description of toppings.
